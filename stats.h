 *
 * This function includes function which will display all maximum , minimum ,mean and median of  data along with function which will calculate
 * maximum minimum mean and median of the data . Also sort_array function will sort the given array in ascending order.

/**function : print_statistics()
 * @brief print the basic statistics of given array including maximum, minimum, mean and median.
 *
 * This function takes an array as input and performs some operations to print 
 * the maximum ,minimum ,mean and median of that data.
 * mean is same as arithmatic average of data and median is the element present at centre.
 *
 * @param array on which we have to perform operation.
 * @param length of the given array.
 *
 * @return prints the maximum , minimum ,mean and median of given array.
 */
/**
 * function : print_array()
 * @brief prints the given array.
 *
 * This function prints the input array when provided with array and it's length.
 *
 * @param array 
 * @param length of the given array
 *
 * @return prints the array.
 */
/**
 * function : find_median()
 * @brief Finds median of the given data.
 *
 * This function finds the median of the elements from array.Median is the middle element in the sorted array.
 *
 * @param array on which we have to perform operation.
 * @param length of the given array.
 *
 * @return median value of elements of array.
 */
/**
 * function : find_mean()
 * @brief Finds mean of the given data.
 *
 * This function finds mean of the elements from array.Mean is basically arithmatic average of given data elements.
 *
 * @param array on which we have to perform operation.
 * @param length of the given array.
 *
 * @return mean value of elements of array.
 */
/**function : find_maximum() , find_minimum()
 * @brief finds maximum and minimum element from given array respectively.
 *
 * This function compares every element of given array to find maximum and minimum element among them.
 *
 * @param array on which we have to perform the operation.
 * @param length of given array.
 *
 * @return maximum and minimum element from given array respectively.
 */
/**function sort_array
 * @brief sorts the given array in ascending order.
 *
 * This function uses insertion sort which is good and eficient technique to sort array of small length.
 *
 * @param array on which operation is to performed
 * @param length of given array
 *
 * @return the sorted array.
